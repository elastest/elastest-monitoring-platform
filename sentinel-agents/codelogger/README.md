# How to send logs to EMP directly from code
This is a guide to show how easy it is to send log messages directly into EMP 
framework. An example code for sending meaningful log messages from a python 
code is included in this folder.

## Key considerations
The requirement for sending inline log messages into EMP are very simple:
- a flat structured json message should be sent
- the EMP series part of an existing space decleration must have this 
**msgSignature** value: *seriesPattern = unixtime:s msgtype:json*
- the json message must have this element in it: 
**"agent":"sentinel-internal-log-agent"**

## Example json messages
```
{
	"agent": "sentinel-internal-log-agent",
	"file": "/sample/codelogger/code-agent.py",
	"level": "trace",
	"method": "<module>:128",
	"msg": "some meaningful log msg goes in here"
}
```

As long as **"agent":"sentinel-internal-log-agent"** field is set in the json 
message, all flat messages are valid messages to be sent into emp. Here is 
another example:
```
{
	"msg": "Returning registered services. Count: 0",
	"agent": "sentinel-internal-log-agent",
	"level": "DEBUG",
	"file": "/app/adapters/log.py"
}
```

## Extending the logging for other languages
The included python file implements a logging class called *SentinelLogger* 
that enables rest of the software to simply instatiate an object of this class 
and send log messages the most natural way.
```
logger = SentinelLogger()
logger.warn("some warning worthy message")
logger.error("some error worthy message")
logger.debug("some debug worthy message")
logger.info("some info worthy message")
logger.trace("some trace worthy message")
```

Similar libraries can be developed for popular languages such as Java, Go, etc. 
The future release of EMP will include more language adapters enabling inline 
logging.

## Dependency management
The included sample code depends on the following python libraries
* jsonpickle==0.9.4
* kafka==1.3.3

You can use **pip3** to install these dependencies before you use the sample code.
